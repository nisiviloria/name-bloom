      "Dear Kaye,\n\nHappy Valentine’s Day, my love Bff Kaye! 💗 This song really reminds me of you, and it helped me a lot more than you probably know. I know the message of this song symbolizes finding hope again when you’re already at the end of the rope, and realizing that even in the hardest moments, praising God can bring you back to light. During my toughest time, this song became my comfort. \n\n I actually discovered Belle Mariano’s song because of you during our OJT. You kept suggesting it and playing it, and you probably didn’t even realize how much that simple thing helped me. In your own little way, you were helping me heal without even knowing it. Thank you for that. \n\nMay this flower remind you of how strong, kind, and special you are to me. Just like this song gave me hope, you also became part of the reason why I kept going. I’m always grateful for you. I love you so much. I miss you, bond us soon. 💐💕",

      "Dear Baks,\n\nHappy Valentine’s Day, bff ko 💗 you deserve this. I know it’s not a real flower, but I still hope you felt surprised when you saw this.(Shet, cinode ko pa ’yan ha, parang medyo over sa effort sa code, pero for you, worth it). \n\nI dedicate this song to you because you always stand the test of time. No matter what happens, you stay strong and you keep going. Every part of me is always here when you need me. My shoulders are always yours to lean on. I’ll never get tired of assuring you that you can always lean on me when your heart feels so heavy. Sasalubungin kita lagi with open arms.\n\n I know life has been so tough lately, but I’m so proud of you. You did it. You didn’t even ask for help, you just faced everything and survived it. Yes, I’m sad for the both of you kasi syempre parehas ko kayong kaibigan, but iba yung sa’yo. Iba ka kay Arwin kasi ikaw yung nakasama ko ng ilang taon. You’re my soul sister, kahit parehas tayong panganay girly na laging strong sa labas pero soft sa loob.\n\n I know your decision wasn’t easy. Ang tagal mo yang pinag isipan before you finally chose yourself. That kind of courage is not easy. I’m so proud of you for choosing what’s healthy for you. You didn’t deserve that kind of love. You deserve something gentle, consistent, and sure, something that will never make you question your worth. \n\nPlease reach out if you need someone. Kahit anong oras pa yan. I’ll listen. I’ll sit with you. I’ll cry with you if needed. Hindi ka mag isa. Even on the days you feel weak, I’ll remind you how strong you really are. I love you, bff ko. Always. 💐 🌻",
